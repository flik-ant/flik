SOA/Microservice workflow made smooth by the Flik ant

## Objectives
Be an execution engine with the following capabilities:
* Distributed workflow executions.
* Invoke (almost) any kind of service suppling necessary stuff related to the
  protocol that it speaks.
* Support for (inside the workflows) parallel and serial executions.
* Select data from execution steps for reuse.
